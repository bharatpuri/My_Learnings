# Basic keywords that are used in Exception handling:

Try - To maintain risky code.
Catch - To maintain exception handling code.
Finally - To maintain clean up code.
Throw - To hand over our created exception object to the JVM manually.
Throws - To delegate the responsibility of exception handling to the caller.

# Customised or user defined exceptions:
Sometime to meet programing requirements we can define our own exceptions such type of exception are called customised or user define exceptions.
Example: toYoungException, toOldException and insufficient founds exception etc.
------------------------------------------------------
Declare the custom exception:
	public class HandleException extends Exception {
		public HandleException(String message) {
			super(message);
		}
	}

# Used custom exception:
	public class Demo {
		public static void main(String[] args) {
			if (age > 60){
				throw new HandleException("Age is not valid. Please provide valid age");
			}
			else 
			System.out.Println("Success")
		}
	}
------------------------------------------------------
Note 1 : throw keyword is best suitable for user define or customised exception but not for predefined exceptions. 
Note 2 : It is highly recommended to define customised exception as unchecked that is we have extends Runtime exception but not exception.
Note 3 :  super(message): To make description available to default exception handler.
