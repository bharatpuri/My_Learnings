##### Identifiers:

A name in java program is called identifier which can be used for identification purpose, it can be method name or variable name class name or label name. 
Class Test {
Public static void main (String[] args){
Int a =10; 
	}
}

Rules for defining java identifiers 
The only allowed characters in java identifiers are: 
A to z
A to Z
0 to 9
 $ and _

-> If we are using any other character we will get compile time error.
	Example Total# this is incorrect.
	
-> Identifiers can’t start with digit 
	example: total123 is valid but 123total is invalid.
	
-> Java identifiers are case sensitive off course java language itself treat as case sensitive programing language.
-> There is no length limit for java identifiers but it is not recommended to take to lengthy identifiers.
-> We can’t use reserved words as identifiers 
	Example int x = 10 this is valid, int if = 20 is invalid. 


-> All predefine java class name and interface names we can use as identifiers.  
-> Even though it is valid but it is not a good programing practice because it reduces readability and creates and confusion.

##### Reserved Words:

-> In java some words are reserved to represent some meaning or functionality such types words are called reserved words.
-> Reserved literals:  true, false and null.
-> True false use for Boolean data types.
-> Null is default value for object reference.
-> Unused keywords are 2:  goto and const.
-> Goto: Usages of goto created several problems in old languages hence some people band this keyword in java.
-> Goto and const are unused keywords and if we are trying to use we will get compile time error.
-> Const: use final instead of const. 
-> Used keywords are 48: 
-> Keywords for data types:  byte, short, long, int, float, double, Boolean and char.
-> Keyword for flow control: if, else, switch, case, default, while, do, for, break, continue and return.
-> Keywords for modifiers: public, private, protected, static, final, abstract, synchronised, native, strictfb, transit and volatile.
-> Keywords for exception handling: try, catch, finally, throw, throws and allert.
-> Keywords for class: class, interface, extends, implements, package and import, 
-> Keywords for objects: new, instanceof, super and this.
-> Void return is also keyword.  In java return type is mandatory if a method won’t return anything then we have to declare that method with void return type.
-> But is c language return type is options and default return type is int.
-> Unused keywords 
-> Enum keyword: (java 1.5)
-> We can use enum to define a group of name Constance.
		Example: enum Month{ JAN, FEB, MARCH…DEC;}
		
-> All 53 words reserved in java contain only lower case alphabets symbols.
-> In java we have only new keyword and there is no delete keyword because distraction of use less object is responsibly of garbage collector.
-> The following are new keywords in java.
-> strictfb 1.2 version
-> allert 1.4 version
-> enum 1.5 version.


####### Data Types:
In java every variable and every expression has some type.
Each and every data type clearly defines.
Every assignment should be checked by compiler for type compatibility because above reason we can conclude java language is strongly typed programing language. 
Java is not considered as pure object oriented programing language because severs OOPS features are not satisfied in java like operated overloading and multiple inheritance etc.
Moreover we are depending on primitive data types which are non-objects.
Except Boolean and char remaining data types are consider as signed data types because we can represent both positive and negative numbers.l
